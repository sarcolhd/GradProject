Colorado Solar Sales Booster
Shane Rodgers Graduate Project 3.11.25

Overview
This project uses Python and simple machine learning to identify high-potential ZIP codes for solar panel sales in Colorado. It demonstrates how data-driven targeting can improve marketing efficiency.
Project Description
The Colorado Solar Sales Booster project:
	•	Analyzes solar irradiance, home ownership, and property values across multiple regions
	•	Uses a decision tree model to predict solar potential
	•	Creates visualizations to guide marketing strategy
	•	Identifies specific ZIP codes and regions for targeted campaigns
Running the Jupyter Notebook
To run this project:
	1	Install required packages:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
	2	Create a new Jupyter notebook or open the provided Colorado_Solar_Sales_Booster.ipynb
	3	Run the cells sequentially to generate the analysis and visualizations
Project Results
Running this notebook will produce:
	1	A data analysis of Colorado ZIP codes and their solar potential
	2	Feature importance analysis showing which factors most affect solar potential
	3	Decision tree visualization explaining the prediction process
	4	Regional comparison across key metrics
	5	Identification of top ZIP codes for targeted marketing
	6	Saved PNG files of all visualizations for use in presentations
Code Sample
Here's a glimpse of the code used in this project:
# Colorado Solar Sales Booster Project

    regions = ["Denver Metro", "Front Range", "Western Slope"]
    data = []

    for i in range(n_samples):

        zip_code = f"80{random.randint(100, 999)}"
        
        data.append({
            "Zip_Code": zip_code,
            "Region": region,
            "Solar_Irradiance": solar,
            "Owner_Occupied_%": f"{owner}%",
            "Median_Home_Value": f"${home_value:,}"
        })
    
    # Create dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df
Notes for Presentation
This project is designed for a PowerPoint presentation that focuses on:
	•	How data-driven targeting can improve marketing efficiency
	•	Which factors matter most for solar potential
	•	Regional differences across Colorado
	•	Specific ZIP codes to target for marketing campaigns
The visualizations generated by this notebook should be incorporated into your presentation for maximum impact.
Requirements
	•	Python 3.7+
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-learn
	•	Jupyter Notebook
